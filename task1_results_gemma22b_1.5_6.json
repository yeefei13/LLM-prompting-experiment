"Let's solve the expression step-by-step, adhering to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

**1. Division:**

* 2 / 2 = 1

**2. Multiplication:**

* 3 * 2 = 6
* 1 * 3 = 3

**3. Addition and Subtraction (left to right):**

* 6 + 2 = 8
* 8 - 2 = 6
* 6 - 3 = 3
* 3 + 1 = 4


**Therefore, the solution of the expression is 4.**
