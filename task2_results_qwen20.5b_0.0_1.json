"The time complexity of the first code snippet is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because it iterates through the array once to calculate the sum.

The second code snippet has a different approach, using an array and a loop instead of a separate variable for storing the sum. The time complexity is also O(n).

Therefore, the first code snippet has better time complexity compared to the second code snippet."
