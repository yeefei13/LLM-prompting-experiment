"Here's a breakdown of the time complexity for your provided code snippets.

**Code 1:** O(n^2) -  This involves nested loops to access elements in an array. 

**Code 2:** O(n)  - Dynamic programming - The sums can be calculated efficiently and directly, using precalculation.


**Code 3:** O(n)  - Direct summation; a very efficient approach for the calculation!
