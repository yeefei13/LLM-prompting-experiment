"It has a complexity of O(n), where n is the size of input vector, since it iterates over each element in the input vector exactly k times.
O(1) means there is no operation within an outer loop. In other words, this algorithm does not use any data structures (such as arrays, linked lists or hash sets). 
This function computes the maximum sliding window from a sliding window of size k."
