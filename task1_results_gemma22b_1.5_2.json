"Here's how to solve that expression using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

**1. Multiplication:**
   *  3 * 2 = 6
   *  2 / 2 = 1

**2. Division:**
   * 1 * 3 = 3 

**3. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):**
   * 6 + 2 - 3 - 3 + 1 = **4**


Therefore, the answer for  \\(3 * 2 + 2 - 2 / 2 * 3 - 3 + 1\\) is **4**.
