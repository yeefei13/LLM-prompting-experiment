"Code 1: The code has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array. This means that the code runs in linear time, regardless of the size of the input.

Code 2: The code has a time complexity of O(1), which means it can be solved without storing intermediate variables or using any external resources like arrays or pointers. It's an efficient solution for this problem.

Code 3: The code has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the size of the array. This means that the code runs in quadratic time, regardless of the size of the input."
