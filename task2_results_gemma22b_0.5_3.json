"Here's a breakdown of the time complexities:

**Rank:**

1. **Code 3 (O(n))**:  This is the simplest and fastest. It iterates through the array once to calculate the sum.
2. **Code 2 (O(n))**: This uses dynamic programming, which can be slightly more efficient than a simple loop for some cases. 
3. **Code 1 (O(n^2))**:  This has nested loops that iterate over the array multiple times. The complexity increases significantly with larger arrays.


**Explanation:**

* **Time Complexity:** How long it takes to run the code, measured in terms of operations. 
    * **O(n):** Linear time - the number of operations is directly proportional to the size of the input (array).
    * **O(n^2):** Quadratic time - the time increases with the square of the input size.
