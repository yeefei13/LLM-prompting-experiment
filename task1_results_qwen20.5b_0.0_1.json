"To solve this math problem, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Multiply \\(3\\) by $2$ to get $6$.
Step 2: Add $2$ to the result from Step 1 to get $8$.
Step 3: Subtract $\\frac{2}{2}$ (which is $1$) from the result from Step 2 to get $7$.
Step 4: Add $1$ to the result from Step 3 to get $8$.

So, the solution to the math problem is:

$$8 + \\frac{7}{2} - \\frac{2}{2} + 1 = 8 + 3.50 + 1 = 12.50.$$"
