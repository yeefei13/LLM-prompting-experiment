"Here's a quick breakdown of their time complexities:

**Code 1:**  **O(n\u00b2)** (Linear + Linear inside loops. O(n^2))
**Code 3:**  **O(n)** (Linear. Just one loop)
**Code 2:**  **O(n)**  (Similar to Code 3, more space use might change the speed slightly)

 **Reasoning**
- **Code 1 & 3** iterate through the array only once. However, in Code 3 they do this n-times
- **Code 2** uses an extra dynamic memory allocation and requires some extra loops  for efficient calculating. It is much more computationally complex


Let me know if you have other coding scenarios you'd like analyzed! "
