"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step, applying order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

**1. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):**

   *  3 * 2 = 6
   *  2 / 2 = 1 
   *  1 * 3 = 3

**2. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):**

   * 6 + 2 - 3 - 3 + 1 = 6 - 3 - 3 + 1 = **1**


Therefore, the solution is **1**.
