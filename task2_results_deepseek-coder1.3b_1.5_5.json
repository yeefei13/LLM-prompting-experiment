"It's unclear how you want to measure the efficiency of this code since it includes a large loop, which isn't usually good for performance. The purpose here is more related to understanding what kind of problems can be solved by using these kinds of data structures and algorithms rather than about benchmarking an algorithm as I mentioned in your last question or simply answering that would not provide us any specific short answer.
