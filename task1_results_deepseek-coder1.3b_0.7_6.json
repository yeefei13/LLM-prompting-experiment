"Sure, I can help you solve this math expression using Python programming language as follows:
```python
# Define the numbers involved in the operation (from least significant digit) 321/4*5-6+7=0
numbers = [3, 2, -2 / 2 * 3 + 8] # we start with a negative number to ensure correct order of operations. The division and multiplication are performed first from left to right in the expression (because Python follows PEMDAS rule) so that is why it starts by multiplying then dividing
# Then, add up all numbers using addition step-by-step: 3+2=5 -> next number will be added. So we start with adding first two and get a negative result to correct the order of operations (because Python follows PEMDAS rule) so that is why it starts by dividing then multiplying
# Finally, add up all numbers using addition step-by-step: 5+8=13 -> next number will be added. So we start with adding first two and get a negative result to correct the order of operations (because Python follows PEMDAS rule) so that is why it starts by dividing then multiplying
# The final answer should now equal zero, which means our expression 3*2+2-2/2*3-3+1 equals -5.0 in python programming language: `print(numbers[0])` will give you the result of this calculation as output (it's a float number).
```python
# Printing final answer using Python print function 
import sympy # This is used to solve equations and display them symbolically, not numeric. It can be useful for debugging or understanding how an expression works in math terms rather than just numerical values like python does with ints/floats etc...  
print(sympy.simplify(-5)) 
```
Please note that the above code will give you a symbolic representation of your result, not numeric value as Python is designed to handle such calculations symbolically for better understanding and debugging purposes rather than numerical values like in case with ints/floats etc...  
Also remember this expression has multiple solutions (it's an equation), so the final answer could be different based on how you solve it.  The above code will give one of them as output, not all possible ones due to lack of a specific condition or constraint in your problem statement such as \"which solution is correct\".
