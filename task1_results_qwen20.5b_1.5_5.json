"The mathematical expression given is:
\\[3 \\times 2 + 2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3\\] 

This can be simplified using basic order of operations. First, we need to handle multiplication and division from left to right.
- We have \\(2\\) in the numerator.
- And after getting a common denominator of 4 from the parenthesis (\\(\\frac{3}{2}\\)), \\(3\\) also gets simplified into \\(\\frac{9}{2}).
- And since we have \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) instead of just \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\), we're applying the inverse operation of multiplication in this expression.
\\[2 \\times 3 = 6\\]
\\[2 + 6 - \\frac{9}{2} = 8.5\\] 

Now, the final answer after applying standard order of operations is: 
\\[8.5\\]

This means the solution for your math expression is \\(8.5\\), as we would typically get a fractional result with multiplication in this context."
