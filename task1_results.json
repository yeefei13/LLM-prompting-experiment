#Scenario1 using Python's built-in eval() function with PEMDAS (Parentheses/Brackets First / Order of Operations) and BODMAS rule for simplifying expressions like in Scenarios2.  
result = ((3 * 2 + (2 - 2)) / 2 + 1 ) #PEMDAS: Parenthesis, Bracket first then Multiplication & Division followed by Addition/Subtraction(BODMAS) and finally addition of the last number in parentheses to get final result.
print(\"Result using PEMDAS rule is : \",result) 
#Output will be -1 as per Scenario2 (PEMDAS / BODMAS).  
```   
Alternatively, we can use Python's operator module which provides overloaded operators for arithmetic operations. Here it goes:    
 ```python     
import operator       # Importing the 'operator' Module in python 
op = {k: v for k,v in zip(map(chr, range(ord('a'), ord('z')+1)), map(lambda x:x ,range(1,5)))}    # Creates a dictionary with operator symbols and their corresponding operations.  
expr_str='3*2 + 2 - 2/2 * 3 - 3 + '     # Defining the expression string in infix notation (PEMDAS / BODMAS).     
#print(f\"Expression is: {op['+']}\")    Prints out operator symbols.  
expr_lst=list(map(lambda x:(x if x not in op else int(op[chr(int(x) + 32)])) , expr_str ))     # Converts the expression string into a list of integers using lambda function and operator dictionary.  
#print (expr_lst, \"is: \", type(expr_lst), \"\
\")    Prints out converted integer expressions in form [int,...] .     
result = reduce((lambda x , y : int(x)  op str(y)), expr_lst ) # Reduce the list of integers using lambda function and operator dictionary.  
#print(\"Result is: \", result, \"\
\")    Prints out final answer in form [int,...] .     
```     This code will give you a solution to your problem by following PEMDAS rule (Parentheses/Brackets First / Order of Operations) and BODMAS.  It also uses Python's operator module for simplifying the expression using overloaded operators in arithmetic operations as per Scenario2(PEMDAS & BODMAS).

    do adding part step by step too.
    A:
    ": "Sure, I can help you solve this math expression using Python programming language as follows:
```python
# Define the numbers involved in the operation (from least significant digit) 321/4*5-6+7=0
numbers = [3, 2, -2 / 2 * 3 + 8] # we start with a negative number to ensure correct order of operations. The division and multiplication are performed first from left to right in the expression (because Python follows PEMDAS rule) so that is why it starts by multiplying then dividing
# Then, add up all numbers using addition step-by-step: 3+2=5 -> next number will be added. So we start with adding first two and get a negative result to correct the order of operations (because Python follows PEMDAS rule) so that is why it starts by dividing then multiplying
# Finally, add up all numbers using addition step-by-step: 5+8=13 -> next number will be added. So we start with adding first two and get a negative result to correct the order of operations (because Python follows PEMDAS rule) so that is why it starts by dividing then multiplying
# The final answer should now equal zero, which means our expression 3*2+2-2/2*3-3+1 equals -5.0 in python programming language: `print(numbers[0])` will give you the result of this calculation as output (it's a float number).
```python
# Printing final answer using Python print function 
import sympy # This is used to solve equations and display them symbolically, not numeric. It can be useful for debugging or understanding how an expression works in math terms rather than just numerical values like python does with ints/floats etc...  
print(sympy.simplify(-5)) 
```
Please note that the above code will give you a symbolic representation of your result, not numeric value as Python is designed to handle such calculations symbolically for better understanding and debugging purposes rather than numerical values like in case with ints/floats etc...  
Also remember this expression has multiple solutions (it's an equation), so the final answer could be different based on how you solve it.  The above code will give one of them as output, not all possible ones due to lack of a specific condition or constraint in your problem statement such as \"which solution is correct\".

     A: ": "The answer to this math problem is -1. 

The solution process is very straightforward and it doesn't involve any specific operations that might help you see patterns or shortcuts to the problem. 

Firstly, we distribute (2*2) from left to right which results in:

-3*2=6

Now multiply the 2 from both sides by 1 from the left. We do this as well because the -2 is not affected by multiplication by 1.

6*(-2)=6*(-1)= -6

Next, distribute (-3*2) again and we have (6*2) which results in:

-6*(2)=-12

Finally, since we can see that (-3*2)*(-2)/(-3)*(-2), all the numbers cancel out. Therefore,

-6*(-2)/(-3*(-2))=-12/(-3*(-2))

So now -6 = 12/-6

We then perform division which is like multiplying negative times a positive, so we divide both sides by -6 to get:

(-12)*(-1)=-6*-1

This results in the same number as before.

-1*(-1)=1

The solution would involve doing the operations in the following order:

Step 1) First we perform addition, then subtraction.

Adding $2$ first gives us $3$, while subtracting $2$ also gives us $3$. Now, we multiply by $2$ (so that our equation becomes: $$3 + 3 = 6.$$  
Next step is to subtract $3$ from this result (because $3 \\times 2 = 6$). In other words, we divide it by two and subtract $3$ from it, getting us with a remainder of $1$. That means the answer to your question is 1.

Therefore, solving this problem in the correct order:

1) First do division: $$3 + 3 = 6$$  
2) Next do multiplication: $$2 \\times 6 = 12$$
3) Lastly do addition (from left to right): $$6 - 3 = 3$$ 
4) Then add what you just got, but since $3$ was added before the $-3$, subtract it from $6$. Doing this, we get: $$6 - 3 = 3$$
5) Lastly add what we just got ($3$), and again, using addition's properties that if a number is added to $3$, we subtract the remaining value of the same number. This time however since the second operation ($-3$ in this case), adds its opposite or its complement (to the right). Since $-3 = -(-3)$ then: $$3 + 0$$
Now, finally combine what we just got ($6$) with what we added ($+3$): $$3 + 0 + 1 = 4.$$  

So finally your solution is:

$4$.
