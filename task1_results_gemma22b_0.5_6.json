"Here's how to solve the expression step-by-step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

**1. Division:**

* 2 / 2 = 1

**2. Multiplication:**

* 3 * 2 = 6
* 1 * 3 = 3

**3. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):**

* 6 + 2 - 2 = 6
* 6 - 2 = 4
* 4 - 2 = 2
* 2 - 3 = -1
* -1 + 1 = 0

**Therefore, the solution is 0.**
