"First, we simplify the operation inside the parentheses. The subtraction `3-2` results in `-1`. Then we calculate `1/2` as `-1*0.5 = -0.5`.

Next, distribute to the coefficients of the terms and subtract them:

- First coefficient of 2 is 2
- Second coefficient of 2 (result from `-1*0.5`) gives us -2
- Third coefficient is `2/2`
- The fourth coefficient, which is negative (`-1*0.5`), will result in `-1`. Then, adding `-2` and `1` to get the final result:

```math

        = 3 + (-2) - (2/2 + 1)
      = 3 - 2 - (-1) / 2
      = 3 + (-2)*(-1)/2
      = 3 + 0.5
```

Finally, the result of `-2/2` or `-1` is added to make it a whole number.

Therefore,

The solution using division and multiplication first from left to right gives:

   - 3 + (-1) / 2 - 1 = -3.5

And the solution with the division and multiplication from left to right also gives:"
