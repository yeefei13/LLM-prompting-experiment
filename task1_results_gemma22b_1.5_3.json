"Let's break down the expression step-by-step:

**1. Multiplication and Division (Left to Right)**

*  3 * 2 = 6
*  2 / 2 = 1
*  1 * 3 = 3

**2. Substitution of Results**

The expression now becomes:  6 + 2 - 3 - 3 + 1 

**3. Addition and Subtraction (Left to Right)**

* 6 + 2 = 8
* 8 - 3 = 5
* 5 - 3 = 2
* 2 + 1 = 3


 **Therefore, the solution to the expression is 3.**
