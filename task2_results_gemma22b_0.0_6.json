"## Efficiency and Big O Notation Analysis:

**Efficiency:** 
* **Time Complexity:**  O(N) - The code iterates through the input array `nums` once.
* **Space Complexity:** O(K) - We use a deque to store the sliding window elements, which has a size proportional to the window size `k`.


**Big O Notation:**

* **Time Complexity:**  O(N) 
* **Space Complexity:** O(K) 



**Explanation:**

The code uses a deque (double-ended queue) for efficient sliding window operations. The time complexity is linear as we iterate through the array once, and the space complexity is proportional to the window size `k`.
