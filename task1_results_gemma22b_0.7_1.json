"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

**1. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):**

   * 3 * 2 = 6
   * 2 / 2 = 1
   * 1 * 3 = 3

**2. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):**

   * 6 + 2 - 3 = 5
   * 5 - 3 = 2
   * 2 + 1 = 3

**Therefore, the answer is 3.**
