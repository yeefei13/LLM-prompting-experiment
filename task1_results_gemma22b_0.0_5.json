"Here's how to solve the expression using both approaches:

**Scenario 1: PEMDAS/BODMAS**

1. **Multiplication and Division (from left to right):**
   * 3 * 2 = 6
   * 2 / 2 = 1
   * 1 * 3 = 3

2. **Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):**
   * 6 + 2 - 3 - 3 + 1 = 6 + 2 - 6 = 2

**Scenario 2: Grouping Similar Operations**

This approach involves grouping terms with the same operation together, then solving them in a specific order.  Here's how it works:

1. **Group like terms:**
   * (3 * 2) + 2 - (2 / 2) * 3 - 3 + 1 
   * (6) + 2 - (1) * 3 - 3 + 1

2. **Solve within each group:**
   * 6 + 2 - 3 - 3 + 1 = 6 + 2 - 6 + 1 = 2


**Final Answer:** The solution to the expression is **2**.
