"**Efficiency:** 

* **Time Complexity:** O(N) - The algorithm processes each element of the input array only once.

**Big O Notation:** 

* **Best Case (All elements within k)**: O(K)  - The code utilizes deque and vectors to keep track of the max values in the sliding window for a maximum efficient time.
