"The code you provided is a C++ program that implements a sliding window approach to find the maximum value in each contiguous subarray of size `k` within an array. It uses a deque to efficiently track the current and previous elements of the sliding window, ensuring that the maximum element seen so far is always at the front of the deque.

Here's a short explanation of how it works:

1. The program starts by initializing two variables: `cont` (the current deque) and `ans` (the resulting vector). These are used to track the maximum value seen in each sliding window, as well as any potential subarrays that have not yet been processed.

2. The program then iterates over the array using a for loop, starting from index 1 up to `k-1`. For each iteration, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element in the deque. If so, it updates the maximum value seen so far and removes the previous element from the deque.

3. After iterating over all elements of the array, the program checks if there are any potential subarrays that have not yet been processed. In this case, it adds the current element to the deque and then iterates over the remaining elements of the array again, updating the maximum value seen so far and removing the previous element from the deque.

4. The process repeats until all elements in the array have been processed or until `k` is reached. At each iteration, the program updates the maximum value seen so far and removes the previous element from the deque to ensure that any potential subarrays are properly tracked.

5. After processing all elements of the array, the program returns the resulting vector containing the maximum values in each sliding window.

In summary, this code efficiently tracks the maximum value seen in each contiguous subarray of size `k` within an array and ensures that any potential subarrays have been properly tracked."
