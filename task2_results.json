**Rank:**

1. **Code 3 (O(n))**:  This is the simplest and fastest. It iterates through the array once to calculate the sum.
2. **Code 2 (O(n))**: This uses dynamic programming, which can be slightly more efficient than a simple loop for some cases.

**Explanation:**

The code uses a deque (double-ended queue) for efficient sliding window operations. The time complexity is linear as we iterate through the array once, and the space complexity is proportional to the window size `k`.

**Explanation:**

The code uses a deque (double-ended queue) for efficient sliding window operations. The time complexity is linear as we iterate through the array once, and the space complexity is proportional to the window size `k`.

1st Code Snippet - sumArray(int arr[], int size) {  // Time Complexity = O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in array 'arr'. This can be considered as quadratic time complexity. The code has nested loops, so it's not efficient for large arrays or data sets with many repetitions due to its high order terms (O(n) * O(n)).
    #include <iostream>   // Time Complexity = O(1). This includes the standard library and only one function call. 
}
2nd Code Snippet - sumArray(int arr[], int size){//Time complexity is also quadratic, but this time it's linear (O(n)). The code creates an array of sums dynamically which requires O(n) space for the 'sums[]'. This can be considered as a combination of constant and linear terms.
    #include <iostream>   // Time Complexity = O(1).  Only one function call, no dynamic memory allocation or deallocation so it's also efficient (O(n)). The space complexity is proportional to the size n in this case which can be considered as linear time.
}   
3rd Code Snippet - sumArray(int arr[], int size){//Time Complexity = O(1), since only one operation, no loops or dynamic memory allocation/deallocation so it's efficient (O(n)). The space complexity is also proportional to the input array. 
    #include <iostream>   // Time and Space complexities are both constant because there\u2019re not nested iterations nor any data structures created in this function, thus they have a time-space tradeoff of O(1). This includes only one operation (addition) which is also considered as linear.

3 ) int main() {...} | Best-case : \u0398(N), Worst case & average =\u0398((n^2)/2). This is because the algorithm has a single for loop running up to n times. | 
    \u2013 It's efficient as it only requires one pass through array and does not use any extra space apart from variables used in loops (i, j) which takes constant time O(1), so its efficiency remains high even with large arrays |

1st Code - O(n^2), because it has a nested loop which runs n times for each element in the array, leading us towards quadratic runtime ie., O(n\u00b2). This is not very efficient. The second code and third ones have linear time complexity as they only iterate through once or twice respectively but still this can be considered less optimal due to its use of dynamic memory allocation (heap) which could lead the program into inefficient usage if large arrays are passed, leading us towards quadratic runtime again ie., O(n\u00b2).

    ": "The efficiency of the provided code is O((n-k)*log n) in worst case scenario, where 'n' represents size of input array and 'k' denotes window length. 

This happens because for each element from index k to (n - k), we are performing a constant time operation: popping elements out the deque if they exceed current number or pushing them back into it in case their value is less than that, which takes O(log n) operations on average and worst-case scenario can be upto log^2(N). 
Therefore overall complexity of this code would also fall under linear time complexities. The reason for using deque here (double ended queue), as it allows us to efficiently pop out the maximum element from both ends in O(1) operation, and push a new number into either end with respecting order which is required by problem statement ie., we need max of each window at any point during sliding.

1st Code Snippet - sumArray(int arr[], int size) {  // Time Complexity = O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in array 'arr'. This can be considered as quadratic time complexity.

    #include <iostream>   // Time Complexity = O(1). This includes the standard library and only one function call. 
}
2nd Code Snippet - sumArray(int arr[], int size){//Time complexity is also quadratic, but this time it's linear (O(n)). The code creates an array of sums dynamically which requires O(n) space for the 'sums[]'. This can be considered as a combination of constant and linear terms.
    #include <iostream>   // Time Complexity = O(1).  Only one function call, no dynamic memory allocation or deallocation so it's also efficient (O(n)). The space complexity is proportional to the size n in this case which can be considered as linear time.

3rd Code Snippet - sumArray(int arr[], int size){//Time Complexity = O(1), since only one operation, no loops or dynamic memory allocation/deallocation so it's efficient (O(n)). The space complexity is also proportional to the input array.

    ": "The efficiency of the provided code is O((n-k)*log n) in worst case scenario, where 'n' represents size of input array and 'k' denotes window length. 

This happens because for each element from index k to (n - k), we are performing a constant time operation: popping elements out the deque if they exceed current number or pushing them back into it in case their value is less than that, which takes O(log n) operations on average and worst-case scenario can be upto log^2(N). 
Therefore overall complexity of this code would also fall under linear time complexities. The reason for using deque here (double ended queue), as it allows us to efficiently pop out the maximum element from both ends in O(1) operation, and push a new number into either end with respecting order which is required by problem statement ie., we need max of each window at any point during sliding.

This happens because for each element from index k to (n - k), we are performing a constant time operation: popping elements out the deque if they exceed current number or pushing them back into it in case their value is less than that, which takes O(log n) operations on average and worst-case scenario can be upto log^2(N). 
Therefore overall complexity of this code would also fall under linear time complexities. The reason for using deque here (double ended queue), as it allows us to efficiently pop out the maximum element from both ends in O(1) operation, and push a new number into either end with respecting order which is required by problem statement ie., we need max of each window at any point during sliding.

    ": "The efficiency of the code is O(n) because each element in nums array needs to be visited at most once, and we are using a deque (double-ended queue), which has both push_back() and pop_front operations on average constant time. The space complexity also depends heavily upon how many elements you're considering for the sliding window maximum problem: if k is small then it will have to store all n numbers, otherwise only one number in deque at a given point of time (due to its nature as double-ended queue).

    A:
    ": "The code you provided is a C++ program that implements a sliding window approach to find the maximum value in each contiguous subarray of size `k` within an array. It uses a deque to efficiently track the current and previous elements of the sliding window, ensuring that the maximum element seen so far is always at the front of the deque.

Here's a short explanation of how it works:

1. The program starts by initializing two variables: `cont` (the current deque) and `ans` (the resulting vector). These are used to track the maximum value seen in each sliding window, as well as any potential subarrays that have not yet been processed.

2. The program then iterates over the array using a for loop, starting from index 1 up to `k-1`. For each iteration, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element in the deque. If so, it updates the maximum value seen so far and removes the previous element from the deque.

3. After iterating over all elements of the array, the program checks if there are any potential subarrays that have not yet been processed. In this case, it adds the current element to the deque and then iterates over the remaining elements of the array again, updating the maximum value seen so far and removing the previous element from the deque.

4. The process repeats until all elements in the array have been processed or until `k` is reached. At each iteration, the program updates the maximum value seen so far and removes the previous element from the deque to ensure that any potential subarrays are properly tracked.

5. After processing all elements of the array, the program returns the resulting vector containing the maximum values in each sliding window.

In summary, this code efficiently tracks the maximum value seen in each contiguous subarray of size `k` within an array and ensures that any potential subarrays have been properly tracked.",

    ": "The code you provided is a C++ program that implements a sliding window approach to find the maximum value in each contiguous subarray of size `k` within an array. It uses a deque to efficiently track the current and previous elements of the sliding window, ensuring that the maximum element seen so far is always at the front of the deque.

Here's a short explanation of how it works:

1. The program starts by initializing two variables: `cont` (the current deque) and `ans` (the resulting vector). These are used to track the maximum value seen in each sliding window, as well as any potential subarrays that have not yet been processed.

2. The program then iterates over the array using a for loop, starting from index 1 up to `k-1`. For each iteration, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element in the deque. If so, it updates the maximum value seen so far and removes the previous element from the deque.

3. After iterating over all elements of the array, the program checks if there are any potential subarrays that have not yet been processed. In this case, it adds the current element to the deque and then iterates over the remaining elements of the array again, updating the maximum value seen so far and removing the previous element from the deque.

4. The process repeats until all elements in the array have been processed or until `k` is reached. At each iteration, the program updates the maximum value seen so far and removes the previous element from the deque to ensure that any potential subarrays are properly tracked.

5. After processing all elements of the array, the program returns the resulting vector containing the maximum values in each sliding window.

In summary, this code efficiently tracks the maximum value seen in each contiguous subarray of size `k` within an array and ensures that any potential subarrays have been properly tracked.",

    ": "The code you provided is a C++ program that implements a sliding window approach to find the maximum value in each contiguous subarray of size `k` within an array. It uses a deque to efficiently track the current and previous elements of the sliding window, ensuring that the maximum element seen so far is always at the front of the deque.

Here's a short explanation of how it works:

1. The program starts by initializing two variables: `cont` (the current deque) and `ans` (the resulting vector). These are used to track the maximum value seen in each sliding window, as well as any potential subarrays that have not yet been processed.

2. The program then iterates over the array using a for loop, starting from index 1 up to `k-1`. For each iteration, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element in the deque. If so, it updates the maximum value seen so far and removes the previous element from the deque.

3. After iterating over all elements of the array, the program checks if there are any potential subarrays that have not yet been processed. In this case, it adds the current element to the deque and then iterates over the remaining elements of the array again, updating the maximum value seen so far and removing the previous element from the deque.

4. The process repeats until all elements in the array have been processed or until `k` is reached. At each iteration, the program updates the maximum value seen so far and removes the previous element from the deque to ensure that any potential subarrays are properly tracked.

5. After processing all elements of the array, the program returns the resulting vector containing the maximum values in each sliding window.

In summary, this code efficiently tracks the maximum value seen in each contiguous subarray of size `k` within an array and ensures that any potential subarrays have been properly tracked.",
