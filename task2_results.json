**Code A:**  `sumArray` (nested loops) - **O(n^2)**

**Code B:** `sumArray` (dynamic memory allocation) - **O(n)**

Here's why:

* **Deque Operations:**  Each time you insert or remove elements from the deque, it requires constant-time (O(1)) operations.  
* **Inefficient Sliding Window:** The sliding window logic is not as optimized as possible. You need a more efficient way to track the maximum value within each window.

**Potential Improvements:**

* **Use a `std::vector` for efficiency in tracking the maximum values.**

3. **Code 1: O(n^2)** - Time complexity of code 1 is quadratic due to the nested loops, resulting in n*n iterations within each loop

    ": "Here's the time complexity breakdown:

**1. Code 3:** O(n) - Linear time.  This is the fastest as it directly sums up all elements of an array in constant space complexity (not just a list of sums to store). 

 **2. Code 2:** O(n) in the best case. Time is O(n) since all we are doing is adding and moving forward, or storing one index on memory at each loop iteration. The worst-case will take some time when the array gets larger (linear to size as well).

 **3. Code 1:**  O(n\u00b2) in the best case or worst-case scenario. It is O(n\u00b2) as the two nested loops go through all possible index combinations within the size of the given array. This code suffers in time complexity, leading it to run slower when compared to the previous examples.

**In short:** 
*  Code 3: Fastest.
*  Code 2 & 1:  Very Similar.

**Explanation:**

* It iterates through the `nums` vector with a window size (`k`), performing an array-based scan. 
* However, some elements are repeated. So we will have to maintain that elements in queue and if they are found we will skip over them (we have to check from front or end depending on the direction).

    ": "Here's a breakdown of the code's efficiency and Big O notation:

**Efficiency:**

* **Time Complexity:**  O(N) \u2013  You are iterating through `nums` exactly once (excluding cases like removing elements).

**Big O Notation:**
 
 * **Best-case (Straightforward sliding window):** O(N) where 'N' is the number of integers. 
 * **Worst-case (Multiple overlapping/removing windows):** O(K), where K is the size of the sliding window
    

**Explanation**


This code utilizes a deque to store elements for your sliding window. This approach ensures that you always have the largest element within the window and its removal at each step can be easily tracked, providing O(N) efficiency when you are only looking at a particular value inside a given time period.

- The first piece of code is a simple loop that iterates over an array twice, which gives it a time complexity of 2*n where n represents the size of the input. This can be considered to have linear runtime because each element in the list needs to be visited at least once (the outer and inner loops).
- The second piece is similar but with additional memory allocation for sums array using dynamic programming approach, which gives it a time complexity also 2*n where n represents size of input. This can still considered as linear runtime because each element in the list needs to be visited at least once (the outer and inner loops) while we are allocating space dynamically with `new` operator for sums array that is another O(n).

- Code 1 is not an efficient solution because it has a nested loop which makes its runtime proportional to square of size n, ie., quadratic in nature due to two loops running from start till end and inside these inner loops. This results into linear time complexity -> Theta(n^2). It's the best we can do for this problem as there are multiple valid solutions (each with a different runtime) that could be used depending on specific requirements or constraints of your program, such as sorting algorithms etc., which makes it inefficient.
- Code 2 is more efficient than code one because instead of recomputation and storing the sum at each step we only store them until current index (i), then add up to get totalSum from sums array after loop ends ie., linear time complexity -> Theta(n). This makes it faster for large inputs.
- Code 3 is also efficient as its runtime remains constant, O(n) because there's only one iteration over the input data (linear), making this solution more optimal in terms of space and speed than other solutions due to their simplicity nature which allows them not needing additional memory allocation or deletion operations for cleanup.

    ": "Sure. Based on time complexity analysis of these three codes below are their ranks (most to least efficient): 
1st Code - O(n^2), because it has a nested loop which runs n times for each element in the array, leading us towards quadratic runtime ie., O(n\u00b2). This is not very efficient. The second code and third ones have linear time complexity as they only iterate through once or twice respectively but still this can be considered less optimal due to its use of dynamic memory allocation (heap) which could lead the program into inefficient usage if large arrays are processed, leading us towards O(n).

    ": "The efficiency of the provided code can be analyzed by looking at its time complexity and space complexity in terms of both Big O notation (time/space). 

Time Complexity Analysis: The main part that takes longer to execute is inside while loop where it checks if current element `nums[i]` should go into deque or not. This operation has a worst-case time complexity as we are checking all elements in the previous window (which can be at most k). Therefore, this portion of code's overall time complexity would also fall under O(k), where 'n', is size of nums array and 'k'.
The space Complexity Analysis: The deque `cont` takes up a constant amount of memory regardless the input. So its total storage requirement remains linear with respect to n, i.e., it'll be proportional to O(1), which simplifies us from being in terms of time complexity (O(n)) into space efficiency as well due to usage only one data structure - deque `cont` that takes up constant amount memory regardless the input size 'k'.

However, to provide you an efficient solution in terms of algorithmic and data structure usage. The provided function uses two deque (sliding window) for maximum value within each sliding windows which has worst-case performance of `O(N*K)` where N is the size of input array nums[] with K as length of a particular subarray to be considered in every iteration, and then we are returning all these max values. 

In terms of time complexity: Each element (num[i]) will only ever get pushed into deque once at most - when it is the first one being added or if its value exceeds/is smaller than current maximum(s). Hence in worst case scenario, each num[] entry would be visited twice. Therefore overall O(N*K) time complexity can occur for this problem statement as well due to nested iteration over array of size N and length K windows respectively which is `O((n-k+1)* k )`

    ": "Sure. I've provided the time complexity analysis for each of your code snippets according to Big O notation (which describes worst-case scenario):

In sumArray() function with first two versions, Time Complexity is `O(n^2)` because in both loops we are doing n iterations which results in quadratic growth. 3rd version has a linear complexity due to using array of size 'size' but accessing index [i-1] unnecessarily within the for loop making it linearly increase i, hence constant factor out leaving us with `O(n)`

In sumArray() function second and third versions are equivalent since both have time complexity is O (N). The first version allocates an array of size 'size' while in each instance we only use 2 integers. And if there were multiple accesses to the same index, then additional iterations would not be performed thus having a constant linear complexity for these situations which remains `O(n)` even when using more space than expected (here used as sum array of size 'size' with extra integer).

    ": "The efficiency of these codes depends on several factors including time complexity. 
Code 1 (Iteration within loop): It has a complex way to sum up an array, using nested loops which increases computational effort and is less efficient than the other two methods in terms of memory usage because it re-computes values from scratch each iteration even when they've already been computed before by prepending new computations.
Code 2 (Dynamic Memory allocation): It uses dynamic memory allocating an array for sums that gets destroyed as soon after function call ends which leads to less efficiency than the first code in terms of time complexity but potentially higher space consumption, especially if large arrays are involved or very heavy computation is done within it and hence has been optimized.
Code 3 (Single Pass): This version doesn't use dynamic memory allocation leading thus reducing its computational load while also providing more efficient way due to single pass through array without the need for extra recomputations in case of a sumArray method where values can be changed once initialized, thereby requiring less space but still taking slightly longer time. 
So it would have been Code three (Single Pass) as an optimal and most least computational cost one among all possibilities considering worst-case scenarios only which is what's called Big O notation with respect to its efficiency score for these cases respectively according the algorithmic complexity, not their memory usage due at any significant time/space tradeoff.

    ": "The code you provided is a C++ program that implements a sliding window approach to find the maximum value in each contiguous subarray of size `k` within an array. It uses a deque to efficiently track the current maximum and update it as it slides over the array.

Here's a short explanation:

1. The function takes two parameters: 
   - nums (vector<int>&): The input vector.
   - k (int): The size of the sliding window.

2. The code starts by initializing an empty deque `cont` to track the current maximum value and its index in the original array. It also initializes a variable `ans` to store the result.

3. Inside the function, it checks if there is more than one element in the deque. If so, it pops the front of the deque (which will be the current maximum) and adds the next element from the original array to the deque. This ensures that we always have a valid sliding window size of `k`.

4. It then slides the window over the remaining elements of the original array by incrementing the index of the deque (`cont`), updating the maximum value in the deque, and checking if there is more than one element in the deque (indicating that it's time to slide the window). If so, it pops the front of the deque and adds the next element from the original array.

5. After sliding the window over enough times, it checks if there are any elements left in the original array. If not, it means we've reached the end of the sliding window, and it returns the current maximum value as the result.

6. Finally, it returns the updated `ans` vector containing the maximum values from each contiguous subarray of size `k`.

This code efficiently finds the maximum value in each contiguous subarray within a given window size, making it an efficient solution for large datasets.",

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, and the space complexity is also O(n). This is because we need to store all elements from the start of the array up to the current element in the sliding window.

The code uses a `deque` (double-ended queue) to keep track of the indices of the elements that have been seen so far. It iterates through the input array, maintaining a sliding window of size `k`. For each element in the window, it checks if it is greater than or equal to the current maximum value and updates the deque accordingly. If not, it removes the front of the deque (which contains all elements from index 0 to the current element) and adds the current element back into the deque.

The program then iterates through the remaining elements in the window, updating the maximum value found so far and appending the new maximum value to the result vector. This process continues until the window size reaches `k`.

In terms of big O notation, this code has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates through each element in the sliding window once. The space complexity is also O(n), as it uses an additional `deque` to store the indices of elements that have been seen so far."

    ": "A: Code 3 has a time complexity of O(n), which means that running it once takes the maximum possible amount of time. Code 2 also has an O(n) time complexity.

C++14 (optimized): O(n)

Optimizing Code 2 would be to not use extra variables by changing i+1 instead of j from while loops to a comparison and incrementing, this way you have two arrays instead of one. To calculate the sums in O(1), using an int is efficient. However, O(n) time complexity still applies and that's not allowed as per C++14 rules.

B: Code 2 has the minimum time complexity with O(n) since only constant O(1) operations are necessary for comparing elements and incrementing index to avoid unnecessary memory usage in these comparisons

Rust code can also be O(n), but due to memory issues it is an option to implement dynamic memory allocation, unlike C++ code. It can't take more than O(1) operation when creating array indices in the Rust standard library.

D: Code 3 and D do not match with what a typical efficient algorithm takes in practice.

Optimizing the first solution would decrease execution time by around half compared to Code 2, though it might also be considered too complex for most problems.
It's difficult without the code numbers you're using or checking which is the correct rank. Here are some ranking criteria:
1. Complexity: C++14 allows an O(n) runtime with only constant O(1) operations instead of O(n^2).
2. Optimizing Solution - C++, Rust, Java (J).
3. Standard Language - C++
   * Complexity can be significantly optimized using O(1) variables by iterating through each number from 0 to i, or
   * O(n) with dynamic memory allocation.

In summary: The most efficient rank would typically match Code 2's complexity score, where C++, Rust and Java (J) have better worst case scenarios. C++ can be the most expensive in terms of worst case time complexity but it also allows some optimization techniques to improve runtime complexity.
Here are their ranks based on complexity scores:
Code A (C++14 optimization): 3
Optimizing Code B: 2
Optimization not applied Code C (not O(n)): 1 
Dynamic memory optimization with O(n) or better in Rust is usually efficient in practice due to optimized operations being used instead of O(n^2). 

So based on those rules, rank #1 would be Code A (C++14 optimization), rank #2 should be code B (Optimizing Solution - C++, Rust, Java(J)), and finally rank #3 will fall under Optimization not Applied with O(n) or better in Rust.",

    give me very short answer!
    A:
    ": "Efficiency analysis is complex and varies with the problem solving algorithm used. The code in this example has O(1) complexity due to a deque-like container that automatically removes and inserts at every step.

To simplify it, instead of creating all possible contorsions on the slide window (i.e., rolling backward one after the other), you can do:

1. Iterate through all indices (not necessarily sequential).

```python
    for(int i = 0; i<nums.size(); i++){
        if(nums[i] == cont.front()) { // checks if nums[i]==currentCont[i-1], which will be at least true as long as index sequence is the current sliding window.
            cont.pop_front();
        }
        
        cont.push_back(nums[i]);
    }  
    ans.push_back(cont.front());
```

So each time step, it pops off the left front (the value before nums[i]), puts back on right end. That's essentially an O(1) search operation at each step, and hence is the most efficient of your question.

Here's a shorter form of this code:

```python
    for(int i = 0; i<nums.size(); i++){
        if(nums[i] == cont.front()) { // checks if nums[i]==currentCont[i-1], which will be at least true as long as index sequence is the current sliding window.
            cont.pop_front();
        }
        
        cont.push_back(nums[i]);
    }  
```

Which, on each pass through the loop, only needs to search at each step for once. That's why this form gets a time complexity of O(1).",
