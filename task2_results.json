    ": "The issue with this code lies on line `myArray`, as it's a local variable that gets destroyed when its scope ends (i.e., function returns). The value of myArray[0] is undefined because the array has not been initialized yet and thus contains garbage values by default due to C++ standard rules for arrays which are zero-initialized in case they were declared with static or automatic storage duration, i.e.:
```cpp 
int arr[size];   // size can be any value here (like say '5') but it will contain unpredictable garbage values by default due to C++ standard rules for arrays which are zero-initialized in case they were declared with static or automatic storage duration, i.e.: {0} if the array is of type int
``` 
This can be fixed using `new` operator: allocate memory dynamically and return a pointer (i.e., address) to it instead which will prevent undefined behavior due to accessing uninitialized data in C++ as per modern standards, i.e.:
```cpp  
int* allocateArray(int size){  // 'size' is not used here but can be any value like say: int n = 10; or whatever you want the array length of your dynamic memory allocation to have (like a constant) if needed for this example, and it will contain unpredictable garbage values by default due to C++ standard rules
    // allocate size bytes on heap  -> new operator is used here. It returns address where allocated block starts in dynamically-allocated RAM  => int* arr = new int[size]; => This line of code does not return any value, it just assigns the memory location to 'arr'
    // initialize array with some values (like say: for(int i=0;i<10;++i) { myArray[i] = 2*i })  if needed. But in this case we are returning arr which is a local variable and will be destroyed when the function returns, so it's not necessary to initialize array here
    return new int[size];} // 'new[] operator allocates memory dynamically on heap for an object of type T (like say: std::array<int>)  ->  It is used in place where you want a block/container that can grow and shrink at runtime. The size will be determined by the argument passed to new, not necessarily equal to sizeof(T).
```  
This code now allocates memory dynamically for an array of 'size' elements on heap (i.e., using `new` operator), initializes it with some values if needed and returns a pointer pointing at this allocated block in the program\u2019s data segment, which is then deallocated when no longer used by returning from function via returned address to prevent memory leakage due C++ standard rules for dynamically-allocationed blocks.
