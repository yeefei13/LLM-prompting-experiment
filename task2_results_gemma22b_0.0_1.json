"The code's efficiency is **O(n)**, where 'n' is the size of the array.  It uses a divide-and-conquer approach with recursion and in-place merging. 


**Explanation:**

* **Divide:** The `splitAndProcess` function recursively divides the array into smaller subarrays.
* **Conquer:** It calls `combine` to merge these subarrays back together, ensuring efficient sorting. 
* **Combine:**  The `combine` function uses a merging algorithm (like two-pointer) to efficiently combine sorted subarrays.

Let me know if you'd like more details on the specific efficiency aspects! "
