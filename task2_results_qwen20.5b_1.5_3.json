"C:

A: The second code snippet has a time complexity of O(n) due to nested loops while the first and third are in O(1). 

The first code snippet's main function calculates the sum using two variables as well as another integer variable `sum`. It is straightforward, but it can be optimized slightly with string concatenation to use just one operation.

Second code snippet has a time complexity of O(n) for computing sum, where n is number of elements in array. The third code snippet's main function simply sums the input array elements without creating separate variables, so its running time is still O(n).

Therefore, C: 2 is more efficient than both other two snippets and second code snippet."
