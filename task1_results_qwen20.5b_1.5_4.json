"To solve this math expression using PEMDAS (Parentheses/Brackets/Monitors/Divisions/Splitting) rules:

\\(3 * 2 + 2 - \\frac{2}{2 * 3} - 1\\)

1. Parentheses/Brackets: For multiplication and division, start with \\(3\\) times \\(2\\) since they can both be multiplied together.

   The result from above simplifies as:
   \\(\\boxed{6}\\)
2. Monitors: Next, multiply \\(2\\) by \\(2\\) to get 4. 

   Now we have:
   \\(\\underline{6} \\underline{\\bigg( 4 - \\frac{1}{4}\\bigg) - 1}\\)

3. Division/Smashing/Splitting: 
     For dividing and then subtracting, take the result of \\(2\\) times \\(4\\) since that is easier to do first than multiplying.
      We have:
     \\(\\underline{\\frac{6}{4} + 8 - 1} = \\boxed{6}\\)
4. Subtracting/Combine: 
   After performing the division from step 3, we must combine the numbers \\(1\\) with themselves since they cancel out each other's effect. This simplifies to:
   \\(\\underline{6}\\)

So the math expression resolves itself to an answer of:

\\(\\boxed{6}\\)"
