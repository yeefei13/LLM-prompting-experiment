"The code's efficiency is **O(n)**, where 'n' is the size of the array.  It uses a divide-and-conquer approach with recursive calls and merging operations. 


**Explanation:**

* **Divide:** The `splitAndProcess` function recursively divides the array into smaller subarrays.
* **Conquer:** It combines the sorted subarrays using the `combine` function, resulting in a fully sorted array.
