"The code's efficiency is **average O(n)** due to potential redundant operations and a need for multiple shifts, especially during the window processing stages. 


Here's why it might be slower than pure array operations for certain use cases:

* **Shifting:** The code heavily involves removing/rearranging elements (like `cont.pop_back()`) before finding new largest element. This can lead to more loops and potentially reduce efficiency.

However, the exact time complexity depends on input data structure (whether the deque helps or hinders), potential overlap with sorting operations, and specific use cases like how often `cont` needs to shift elements during sliding windows. 


**If you could provide an input scenario or performance metric concerns, that might make the analysis more targeted!**
