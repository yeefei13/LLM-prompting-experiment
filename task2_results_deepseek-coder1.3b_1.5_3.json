"I'm sorry but your input isn't complete. The question lacks specific answers to be ranked by time complexity for all three code snippets provided above (i.e., sumArray(int arr[], int size)). Could you please provide the answer in each scenario so I can rank them? If not, here are my assumptions based on your responses:
    - Code 1 has a simple loop nested inside another one and performs O(n^2) time complexity where n is the number of elements. This would be classified as second-effcient because it's almost unavoidable (the worst case scenario for outerloop depends completely on innerLoop, ie., at maximum times).
    - Code 3 has a single loop that doesn\u2019t depend upon previous iterations which will also give an efficient result with time complexity of O(n), second-efficient if you think so. The code is simple and clean thus giving it the efficiency rank (1/2) in this case, because as efficiently or only barely as possible at least have one less loop to handle its operation than Code 3 does when there are several loops involved which will be of larger time complexity(O).
    - Lastly for code two; given that you're creating a new array and summing up each element in the input (also O n, as needed operations is mostly handled by accessing elements from this 'new-created' multiplesize indexed list), it will also be rated at an efficiency rank because its time complexity cannot less than overall largest case of Code 2(it operates under multiple inner loop iterations).
