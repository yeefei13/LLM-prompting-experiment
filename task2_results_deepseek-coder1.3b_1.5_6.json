"The provided code implements a window-based algorithm for finding the maximum in each sliding window of size 'k' over input array nums[].  The main challenge is that it uses deque which provides constant time complexity operations at both ends. In addition, because our goal to optimize space while ensuring efficiency (with small auxiliary memory requirements), we pop off from either end whenever a larger number emerges or when smaller numbers fall out of the current window size and push in new maximum values until this happens again using `pop_back` function that takes constant time operations. Thus by taking into account both 'time complexity' and space, it has an overall efficiency around O(n).
